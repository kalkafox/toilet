This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong and
secure ASCII art generation, it will only output ugly things.

See NEWS for the work in progress.



This is Kalka speaking. No, I did NOT make this script. This is a fork from https://github.com/cacalabs/toilet

Visit http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/toilet for more info. Credits go to cacalabs and https://github.com/samhocevar

Thank you for making this brilliant script!


This modified version contains different filters in the form of colors for the LGBT community. So far, these have been added:

- Asexuality (filter_ace or --filter ace in the code)
- Bisexuality (filter_bi or --filter bi in the code)
- Pansexuality (filter_pan or --filter pan in the code)
- Transexuality (filter_trans or --filter trans in the code)

More will be added soon, and there are still some things to tweak.
